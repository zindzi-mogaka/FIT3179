NOTES,,,,,
*,"The designations employed and the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The term “country” as used in this publication also refers, as appropriate, to territories or areas. The names and composition of geographical areas follow those presented in “Standard country or area codes for statistical use” (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/49/Rev.3), available at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm.",,,,
(a),"The column labeled “Type of data” indicates the type of data used in deriving the estimates presented. The codes used are: B, which indicates that estimates were derived from data on the foreign-born population; C, which indicates that estimates were derived from data on foreign citizens; R, which indicates that the number of refugees or persons in refugee-like situations as reported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or, where appropriate, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) were added to the estimates, and I, which indicates that there were no data on international migrants for the country or area concerned and that the estimates presented were imputed. ",,,,
(b),"The designations “more developed regions” and “less developed regions” are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process. More developed regions comprise Europe, Northern America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.",,,,
(c),"Less developed regions comprise all regions of Africa, Asia (excluding Japan), Latin America and the Caribbean plus Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia.",,,,
(d),"The group of least developed countries, as defined by the United Nations General Assembly, currently comprises 47 countries: Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, United Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia.",,,,
(e),"The country classification by income level is based on June 2018 GNI per capita from the World Bank. As data on the GNI are not available for all countries or areas, the migrant stock figures by income groups do not add up to the world total. See Annex for details.",,,,
(f),"Countries and areas are grouped into seven Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) regions as defined by the United Nations Statistics Division and used for The Sustainable Development Goals Report (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/regional-groups/). The seven SDG regions are: Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Africa and Western Asia, Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Oceania, and Europe and Northern America.   These regions are further divided into 22 geographic subregions. Because of the magnitude of migrant stock in the SDG region Europe and Northern America and to maintain continuity with previous revisions of the international migrant stock produced by the Population Division, Europe, combining the four subregions Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe and Western Europe, and the subregion Northern America are also presented separately. The names and composition of geographical areas follow those of “Standard country or area codes for statistical use” available at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm as of 1 June 2019.",,,,
