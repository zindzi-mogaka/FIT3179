NOTES,,
*,"The designations employed and the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Secretariat of the United Nations concerning the legal status of any country, territory or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The term “country” as used in this publication also refers, as appropriate, to territories or areas. The names and composition of geographical areas follow those presented in “Standard country or area codes for statistical use” (ST/ESA/STAT/SER.M/49/Rev.3), available at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm.",
(a),"The column labeled “Type of data” indicates the type of data used in deriving the estimates presented. The codes used are: B, which indicates that estimates were derived from data on the foreign-born population; C, which indicates that estimates were derived from data on foreign citizens; R, which indicates that the number of refugees or persons in refugee-like situations as reported by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or, where appropriate, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) were added to the estimates, and I, which indicates that there were no data on international migrants for the country or area concerned and that the estimates presented were imputed. ",
(b),"The designations “more developed regions” and “less developed regions” are intended for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgement about the stage reached by a particular country or area in the development process. More developed regions comprise Europe, Northern America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.",
